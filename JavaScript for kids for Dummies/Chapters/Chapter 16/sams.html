        <p>You are the captain of a spaceship named "The Flying Hippo." One day, you’re working on tuning up your ship’s engines when you get an urgent message on your space phone:</p>
        <p>"Captain, one of our Mars robots is sick. We need you to go to Mars immediately and retrieve it so that we can fix it and download the results of its important experiments."</p>
        <p>You remember that you’re supposed to go to a meeting of the Space Scouts tonight, and you were really looking forward to it. But, on the other hand, the other Space Scouts would understand that this mission is very important.</p>
        <p>What do you do? Go to Mars, or stay home?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="storyPart" id="answer02">
        <p>You chose to stay home. The Space Scouts will miss you, but you feel good about your decision. Perhaps you can help the robot another time.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="storyPart" id="answer11">
        <p>You have decided to go to Mars! You board your spaceship and prepare for the journey. After a thrilling flight, you arrive on Mars and find the robot.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="storyPart" id="answer12">
        <p>You chose to stay home. The robot will have to wait, but you enjoy your meeting with the Space Scouts.</p>
